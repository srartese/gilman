				 <h3> Preface </h3>
				 <h4> "If all else fails, remember that this experience is temporary. "</h4>
				 <p class="postcontent"> I have enrolled my 3rd Fall semester at RIT Croatia in Dubrovnik.  This is the story of my journey as I experience different countries, cultures, and awkward encounters.  Studying abroad is not just about the places you go, but the process of uprooting and adapting.  From August 21st until December 18, 2016, I will be in the arms of Europe. These are the chapters in my study abroad story. </p>

				 <h3> Chapter 1: Ireland </h3>
				 <h4> August 21, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent"> 
					 Dublin is a beautiful place! It might just be the accents but everyone seems very nice and welcoming.  Our arrival began with not understanding public transportation and having a man seeing our confusion, offering some helpful advice.  We proceeded to ride in a taxi with a very friendly Irish man who told us about his family and his many visits to the United States (as much as I could understand).  Our Air BnB was kind enough to let us wake them up at 7am to leave our belongings until we could check in around 2pm so the rest of our day was spent adventuring and trying not to fall asleep in public. Day one we spent seeing Trinity College and the book of Kells, parks, Temple Bar, and the Jameson Distillery.  Day two was a day full of Guinness Storehouse which was well worth it.  They have an amazing view from the sky bar of the rolling hills and the city. In a few days I learned so much of the history and process that goes into making a proud whiskey and beer.  
				<br />
				Aside from the liquids consumed we did find some great places to eat. This first was a random place we found walking and I enjoyed the most delicious burger ever found.  The second was the Brazen Head, which was a very cute styled pub with a great beef stew. Overall what I saw of Dublin was great. A little rain and a lot of walking was a good change of pace compared to Rochester. 
				
				<br />
				<div class="listpnt">
					Take away: 
				<ul>
					<li> Most places you need to be assertive (ask for the check)</li>
					<li> Always ask for the student discount if you have your ID, you save a decent amount of money</li>

				 <h3> Chapter 2: London </h3>
				 <h4> August 26, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent">
					 Our arrival to London was less than exciting. Public transportation seems to be a constant struggle and unfortunately taxis are overly expensive (we learned that the hard way).  London had so many tourists all around the major attractions so it was nice to wander in the less populated areas.  The best place to nap during the mid-afternoon is in St.James Park.  We spent a few afternoons here and it was so relaxing to read under the large trees.  One of my favorite places.
						<br />
					 We went saw Buckingham of course but we also went through Kensington Palace where they had a beautiful garden to walk around and there were not very many tourist because it is a bit of a further walk from the center attractions in London.  I would highly recommend taking a walk through Hyde Park which is way bigger than the map can even show.  It is huge and there are some free art exhibits you will pass inside.  Feels like you're walking through a field of flower gardens and somehow end up along a beach.  It is amazing. Another amazing thing was this cuban place by our hostel.  It was called Cubana and all I have to say is to go.  Go as fast as you can but don't be deterred if there is a pack of people outside, they are probably just there to drink.  There are seats inside.  				
					 <br />
					 Other fun attractions were the London Eye, Tower Of London, and the British Museum.  The London Eye is a good thing to do if you have never been before but the earlier you go, the better chance you have of not waiting all day.  The Tower of London was great to walk along the water to get to and great view of the bridge.  The inside also had a lot of historic things to see like the crown jewels and the different types of amor throughout the years.  Finally, the British Museum was amazing and free!  It had more things to see than I even thought possible. Would recommend to give enough time to go through the exhibits you want to see but don't try to see everything.  It would be an overload of history. 
					 <div class="listpnt">
					 <br />Take away: 
				<ul>
					<li> Don't take a taxi. Just don't.</li>
					<li> Ask your hostel for discount codes on tourist attractions</li>
					<li> Happy hour is VERY popular (and busy) so if you're hungry good luck but it will be worth it.</li>

				 <h3> Chapter 3: Amsterdam </h3>
				 <h4> August 28, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent">
					 We had a rather long day when it came to getting there.  We had accidently forgot to stop the tram at the stop we needed and had to walk all of our luggage about a mile back towards our Air BnB. It was really fun to then carry our luggage up the tiny spiral staircase three floors.  Luckily it was worth it and our hosts were absolutely amazing. We headed straight for the Anne Frank House and the line seemed long but got in rather quickly. The magnitude of what I had read in school finally made sense.  It is definetely something everyone should walk through and get the experience of.  We walked around the area to find some chocolate covered waffles at Sara's Chocolate Bakery. 10/10 would eat all the waffles again. Down the street from there was a street performer who was less than exciting however we did meet two gentlemen from the UK who made some great conversation while the show was going on.
					 <br />
					 The rest of our trip included walking around parks, a canal tour along the canalways, the Heiniken Experience, and unfortunately no more waffles.  We had a very early flight out to Croatia so no crazy nights, just some very chocolately gelato.
					 </p>
					
					 <div class="listpnt">
					 	 <br />Take away: 
				<ul>
					<li> Walk around in popular areas at night and explore anything that raises interest.</li>
					<li> Your host (air bnb) are the best people to ask for advice on the area.</li>
					<li> There is a lot more to enjoy than the red light district. </li>

				 <h3> Chapter 4: Dubrovnik </h3>
				 <h4> August 29, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent"> 
					 Landing in Dubrovnik was the best moment of the entire trip.  After traveling and exploring for days I was exteremely ready to settle in somewhere.  We had a layover in Serbia that was extended and almost didn't get seats on the fight for.  From the plane we were able to see the big bridge and landed right in the mountains.  I had never in my life seen mountains as gigantic as the ones now surrounding me.  Our mentor picked us up to bring us to our new home which just took my breath away for the entire trip.  We drove on a windy road along the coast until we reached Babin Kuk.  Our apartment was kind of small but included three kittens who love to cuddle.  My bed touched my bestfriends end to end, that is how small our room was. Just enough space to stand up and stretch.  We also had no drier which is normal on the coast so we had to hang even our underwear outside.  When in Croatia...
					 <br />
					 We then went on a trip to grab some grocceries which we learned might take some adjusting to.  The store did not have a ton of options and did require bringing your own bag to carry everything half a mile back.  We then got dinner at a Tutto Bene which has a great chicken tortilla however gave me a lot more food than could fit in my stomach.  My first sunset in Croatia I sat on the beach eating. Nothing better than that! 
					 <br />
					 To end our first night we all went night swimming at the beach right next to our house.  Truly a good start to our adventure abroad. 
					  <div class="listpnt">
					  <br />Take away: 
				<ul>
					<li> Be prepared to grocery shop. Mentally and physically. </li>

				 <h3> Chapter 5: RIT Croatia </h3>
				 <h4> September 2, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent">
					 First day means orientation! Or in other words a hike up a billion stairs to the police station to file for our visas. The school is right outside of the city walls past Seasame, a popular coffee shop.  There is another close by more popular to students called Art Cafe.  It can't be missed with its vibrant colors and bathtub seating. 
					 <br />
					 The school itself is a building with four floors so it is very hard to get lost.  It was not what I had expected especially coming from huge campus in New York.  One thing that the Dubrovnik campus had over Rochester was localtion.  The building is within walking distance of two different beaches.  I never though breaks between classes could be so relaxing. 
					 <div class="listpnt">
					 	 <br />Take away:

				 <h3> Chapter 6: Exploring 'Home' </h3>
				 <h4> September 5, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent">	 	 
					 Our first weekend was a great opportunity to go on an adventure.  Unfortunately I have been terribly sick so a hike was not the easiest thing to do.  As a house we decided to go on a hike at the park near our house.  There were two trails and we went on both which gave us two amazingly beautiful views of the ocean water.  It was extemely hot so we ended our hike with a little swim at the beach we went our first night.  I learned quickly that you never know when you will want to swim so always be ready.
					 <br /> 
					 The rest of the weekend we also found new paths around our house along the water, new stores, and down by the bay where the boats dock.  I personally went for a run and found an outdoor gym right next to the water which was really nice.  
					 <div class="listpnt">
					 	 <br />Take away:

				 <h3> Chapter 7: Live Local, Explore Everywhere  </h3>
				 <h4> September 14, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent"> Although technically we are not tourists, we really are so we embraced that.  Not many things we have done in Dubrovnik have been touristy, in fact up to this point we have we have tried pretty hard to just blend in and get adjusted.  So to embrace the tourist in ourselves we went kayaking with a group of other tourist.  We went at sunset and paddled to a cave to snorkel in.  We got sandwhiches there and spent a while just exploring.  When we finsihed there we kayaked all the way around Lokrum the island near the old town and back to shore. Since it was a sunset tour we also got local wine on arrival in mini bottles.  Overall we got a great view of the city walls and the island plus a really good arm workout.  It was worth doing and a lot of fun!

				 <h3> Chapter 8: Montenegro </h3>
				 <h4> September 18, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent"> As apart of our costs for study abroad, we are included into three excursions. This was the first and we visited our neighboring country, Montenegro.  When I had arrived in Dubrovnik I thought I had landed in the most beautiful mountains ever. Well when we got closer to our destination I knew that was about to change.  Montenegro's mountains got more intense than I had expected they could.  As a part of our trip we went to visit a very special religious island and got a tour of the church.  Afterwards we continued to our tour of Kotor and hike up the mountain.  Since we were limited on time we were only able to hike up a portion of the mountain so I definetely would want to go back to complete the hike.  Even from the middle, the view of the city was astonishing.  I really hope more people get the chance to visit the town.  I know it is not the most popular of destinations because it is not well known but it definetely should be.
					 <div class="listpnt">

				 <h3> Chapter 9: Night Life </h3>
				 <h4> September 25, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent">  
					 I am not one to go out and go clubbing but as a part of the European culture it is something to experience.  We made friends so they welcomed to show us the way to Croatian night life.  Lets just say it was not what I had expected.  They head to the old town just as the last bus is making its rounds.  They then get together for drinks until 2am when they head to Revolin for some music and dancing.  Normally most people stay until buses begin running again around 5am or 6am.  My roommate and I decided it was not worth it and begin walking back with a group of kids who also lived the 2 miles away.  It was a pleasant but long walk home.  We then continued to sleep the afternoon away and learn that sometimes night life is good to experience maybe just once or twice.  It also got harder during the semester when we would have make up classes on Saturdays.   
					 <div class="listpnt">
					 	 <br />Take away:

				 <h3> Chapter 10: Bosnia & Konavle & Cavtat </h3>
				 <h4> October 9, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent"> 
				 	Some other trips I was lucky enough to go on was a day trip to Bosnia with my roommate and her family, as well as our second excursion with the school.  Bosnia was a good chance just to walk around Mostar and see some really beautiful waterfalls along the way.  It was a bit jaring in Bosnia because there are still bullet holes in the buildings from the war.  That tour we learned a lot about the relgion of the region and culture after the war.
					 <br />
					 The second excursion was my day trip to Konavle and Cavtat it was downpouring in the morning but cleared up after lunch which was a traditional meal consisting of pork neck, potatotes, rakia, and salad.  After lunch we walked around a beautiful area near the water and enjoyed the warmth after a chilly, wet morning.  It was great to see a place so close to Dubrovnik but very different.
				 	 <div class="listpnt">

				 <h3> Chapter 11: Orchastra & Deans List </h3>
				 <h4> October 11, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent"> 
				 	One of the nights I looked into the Dubrovnik Orchastra as one of my professors back in Rochester had recommended. They had shows over the course of a few months but I managed to find one with some common theme songs including Game of Thrones.  As some may know this is a TV series popularly filmed in Dubrovnik so it made it more exciting.  I had never previously gone to real sympthony orcastra performance before so learning that many of the players are really young and super talented made me wish I stuck with music.
					 <br />
					 Another night I spent at the Deans List Dinner. In Croatia they do acedamic celebration right!  They invite everyone and professors to a fancy dinner to celebrate hard work. They served what a town on the sea is known for, sea food and many tasty treats.  It was a great opportunity to meet new professors and talk outside the classroom with those we have. 
				 	 <div class="listpnt">
					 	 <br />Take away: 
				<ul>
					<li> Do well in school.</li>
					<li> Make friends with professors.</li>

				 <h3> Chapter 12: Adventures</h3>
				 <h4>  October 18, 2016</h4>
				 <p class="postcontent"> 
				 	Malls are very different the further you get from home.  To go shopping required a 20 minute bus ride to a larger building that held a total of 4 stores.  It was nice to get outside the old town but definetely not what I had expected.  The only store that I recognized was H&M which I have learned is extremely popular in Europe.  One of the other stores had products normal to America and it was really exciting to see those products again.  The old town is so small that it is very rare to see products I am so use to like Oreos or peanutbutter.  We spent hours in the few stores.  Since I had only packed a few long sleeves, when it started to hit the bora season I got rather cold so I took opportunity of this shopping adventure.  Buying clothes there was not in the Croatian Kuna but rather the Euro, not commonly used in the Croatian area.
					 <br />
					As for other adventures we got to go on a field trip with our Environmental class to hike up the mountain that overlooks the old town.  We left really early so that we could hike up the mountain instead of taking the cable car.  The moutain has a path that is normally used for a religious retreat to pray at each point all the way to the top.  At the top there is museum from the time during the war, restaurant, and a great view.

				 <h3> Chapter 13: Rome</h3>
				 <h4> October 24, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent"> 
				 	I could talk about Rome forever! It was absolutely amazing! I did not expect the magnitude of everything. We stayed just down the road from the Colosseum so we ate dinner gazing at it.  The following days we saw everything and walked everywhere. We walked all over the Romum Forum, the Trevi Fountain, squares, Vatican City, the Spanish Steps, and basically anywhere our feet could take us.  Italy is also a beautiful place for all the Italian food and all the bakery items.  If I can suggest somewhere for people to visit, it is definetely Rome.  It can't be taken in by photos or words. Just go.
				 	 <div class="listpnt">

				 <h3> Chapter 14: Split & Krka </h3>
				 <h4> October 30, 2016 </h4>
				 <p class="postcontent"> 
				 	As our last and final excursion we took a overnight trip to Split and Krka.  My roommate and I had previously arranged with the tavel angency that some our free time would be spent in Omis so we would be able to go ziplining through the mountains.  Naturally I am terrified of heights but it was actually not scary at all.  It was a nice glide with a beautiful view. Along the way we also made some good friends within our group. I would definetely do that again but next time hopefully somewhere new.
					 <br /> 
					 Now we then continued to Split where we saw a real sized mall and got a private tour of the old town.  We spent the night there then continued the next morning back toward home or rather our stop at Krka National park. Krka is gigantic and feels like upstate New York.  It is one of the most beautiful parks I have ever seen with the waterfalls and paths.  I wish I could have walked arount longer or just sat because it was so peaceful.

				 <h3> Chapter 15: More of Dubrovnik </h3>
				 <h4>  November 25, 2016</h4>
				 <p class="postcontent"> 
				 	In last few weeks Dubrovnik threw some surprises.  They hold a winter festival in the old town from the end of November until Feburary which includes tiny decorated houses that sell Christmas items and food.  They also have events on stage and performances by local youth activities.  It also brings all of the locals out of hiding from the off season and the whole atmosphere of the old town changes.  Along with the tourist being at a minmum, it gave us a great opportunity to walk the city wall and see the whole city from all angles.  It is important to take opportunities of down time and less people. The old town in the off season can actually be a lot of fun. 
					 <br />
					 This was also my first experience with a holiday away from my family.  My roommates family visited and we made up our own Thanksgiving but it was a little hard this year.  My sister is very very pregnant and I am a little sad I am missing being around that.  We obviously don't celebrate it as a holiday outside of America so we made sure to still make time outside of school for it.  For our Thanksgiving we made random foods we liked and cooked a small chicken in place of turkey. We then had drinks on the water so I cannot complain too much.

				 <h4>  December 13, 2016</h4>
				 <p class="postcontent"> 
				 	During finals week most of my courses were finished the week prior so we had a lot of free time.  My roommate and I took advantage of this to go Zagreb for a few days.  This was a really great time because they also had their winter festival set up and it is 20X larger than the one in Dubrovnik.  It also is the capital of Croatia so there are so many places to see and things to do.  We were able to see RIT Croatia in Zagreb which was a lot more modern than our own location.  We also spent a day to go to Plitvice National Park which is listed as one of the most beautiful parks to visit. That is very true from what I saw and it is so easy to get drawn in to the longer trails.  We lucked out with some amazingly warm weather for the time of the year so we were able to spend hours walking around and enjoying the views.

				 	I spent four months living and breathing Croatia life.  Overall it was a change but change makes everything more fun and broadens your perspective.  I would have never gotten the chance to see all the countries I did.  Flying home I had time to really think about everything I had experienced.  The people I met have taught me what it is like to live somewhere else and a new way to do it.  I never had the chance to really experience living anywhere other than America.  It still is very hard for me to explain exactly what it was like but I feel more open to new things. I was always very stuck in what I knew and with food especially I was afraid to try new things.  People everywhere are all the same but we just find our own way to go day by day.  I will go back to Croatia one day and I will continue to tell everyone about my time there.  I am so happy I went and some days I am sad that I have to be back here.  If there is one thing I will not miss is the days of traveling it takes to get to and from, everything else is beyond anything I could have ever expected.
